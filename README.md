# Code-Cache-Reader
A project to allow the code cache subfolders of Chromium based browsers to be read. The project was originally intended for reading compiled wasm, but the code is good
for reading compiled js as well.
The inspiration was the Nirsoft ChromeCacheView software that allow the viewing of the HTTP network cache.
